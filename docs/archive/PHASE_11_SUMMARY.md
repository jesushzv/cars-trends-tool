## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow:
```
User → Browser Login → Export Cookies → fb_cookies.json
                                              ↓
                                    Scraper loads cookies
                                              ↓
                                    Playwright injects cookies
                                              ↓
                                    Navigate to Marketplace
                                              ↓
                                    Verify authentication
                                              ↓
                                    Extract listings
```

### Data Extraction Strategy:
```
1. Load search results page
2. Find all listing links (multiple strategies)
3. Extract basic info from cards (title, price)
4. For incomplete data: visit individual pages
5. Extract engagement metrics (if available)
6. Parse car details from title/description
7. Normalize and validate data
8. Return structured listings
```

### Error Handling Layers:
1. **Cookie validation** - Checks file exists, valid JSON, not template
2. **Authentication check** - Detects login redirects
3. **Rate limiting** - 2-5 second delays between requests
4. **Timeout handling** - 15-30 second timeouts with fallbacks
5. **Graceful degradation** - Returns partial data if some fields fail
6. **Comprehensive logging** - DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR levels

---

## 🎓 What The User Needs To Do

### Immediate Action Required:
To actually scrape Facebook Marketplace, the user must:

1. **Export Facebook Cookies:**
   - Follow instructions in `backend/HOW_TO_GET_FB_COOKIES.md`
   - Use Cookie Editor browser extension (recommended)
   - Export cookies from facebook.com

2. **Save Cookies:**
   - Create `backend/fb_cookies.json`
   - Paste exported cookies (JSON format)
   - Verify format is correct (not template)

3. **Test Scraper:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python scrapers/facebook_marketplace.py
   ```

4. **Use API:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/scrape/facebook?max_results=5"
   ```

---

## 📈 Expected Results (After User Setup)

### Once user provides cookies:

**Successful Scraping:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "platform": "facebook",
  "scraped": 5,
  "saved_to_db": 5,
  "duplicates_skipped": 0,
  "listings": [
    {
      "title": "2020 Honda Civic EX",
      "price": 18000.0,
      "url": "https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/123456789",

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### What We Did:
- ✅ Added `fb_cookies.json` to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Clear warnings in documentation about cookie security
- ✅ Template file prevents accidental use
- ✅ No cookies stored in code or commits
- ✅ User owns and controls their cookies

### User Responsibilities:
- Keep `fb_cookies.json` secure (never share)
- Don't commit cookies to git (already prevented)
- Refresh cookies every 30-60 days
- Monitor Facebook account for unusual activity
- Log out of Facebook to invalidate cookies if concerned

---

## 🚀 Performance

### Estimated Scraping Speed:
- **Search page**: 3-5 seconds
- **Per listing** (basic): 0 seconds (extracted from search)
- **Per listing** (detailed): 2-3 seconds (if visiting individual page)
- **Total for 10 listings**: 5-10 seconds (search results only)
- **Total for 10 listings** (detailed): 25-35 seconds (with individual pages)

### Optimization Strategies:
- Extract as much as possible from search results page
- Only visit individual pages if data missing
- Configurable `max_results` parameter
- Headless mode for faster operation

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### By Design:
1. **Requires User Cookies** - Can't scrape without authentication
2. **Cookie Expiration** - User must re-export every 30-60 days
3. **Rate Limiting** - Facebook limits request frequency
4. **Dynamic Selectors** - Facebook changes HTML frequently, may need updates
5. **Region Specific** - Currently focused on general vehicles category

### Potential Issues:
1. **Account Risk** - Facebook might detect scraping (mitigated by delays)
2. **HTML Changes** - Facebook updates their site (fallback strategies included)
3. **Cookie Theft Risk** - User must keep cookies secure
4. **CAPTCHA** - Facebook might show CAPTCHA (user must solve manually)
