# Phase 11 Progress Report

## Overview
**Phase**: Facebook Marketplace Scraper (Third Data Source)  
**Started**: October 25, 2025  
**Completed**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete (Infrastructure Ready, Awaiting User Cookies for Testing)

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Sub-Phases

### **Sub-Phase 11.0: Research & Reconnaissance** ‚úÖ
**Time**: 15 minutes  
**Status**: Complete

**What was done:**
- Created `FB_MARKETPLACE_RESEARCH.md` with comprehensive research
- Documented Facebook Marketplace structure and requirements
- Identified authentication requirements (login required)
- Analyzed anti-bot measures (rate limiting, CAPTCHA, JS rendering)
- Determined data available on platform (engagement metrics confirmed)
- Assessed risks (account suspension, IP blocking)

**Key Findings:**
- Facebook Marketplace **requires authentication** for full access
- Heavy JavaScript rendering (needs Playwright, not just requests)
- Engagement metrics available: Saves, possibly Likes, Views
- Rate limiting is aggressive
- Cookie-based authentication is safer than automated login

---

### **Sub-Phase 11.1: Basic FB Scraper Structure** ‚úÖ
**Time**: 20 minutes  
**Status**: Complete

**Files Created:**
- `backend/scrapers/facebook_marketplace.py` (initial structure)

**What was done:**
- Created scraper module with proper imports
- Implemented basic error handling
- Added logging and status messages
- Tested with simple requests (confirmed FB blocks them)
- Laid foundation for Playwright integration

**Testing:**
```bash
python backend/scrapers/facebook_marketplace.py
# Result: 400 Bad Request (expected - FB requires auth and JS)
```

---

### **Sub-Phase 11.2: Playwright Setup** ‚úÖ
**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Status**: Complete

**What was done:**
- Encountered Python 3.13 compatibility issue with Playwright 1.40.0
- Upgraded greenlet to 3.1.1 for Python 3.13 support
- Installed Playwright 1.49.1 (latest version with Python 3.13 support)
- Installed Chromium browser (131.0.6778.33)
- Verified Playwright works with test script

**Dependencies Added:**
```
playwright==1.49.1  # backend/requirements.txt
greenlet==3.1.1     # Dependency, installed separately
```

**Testing:**
```bash
pip install playwright==1.49.1
python -m playwright install chromium
# Test: Successfully launched browser and navigated to Google
```

### **Sub-Phase 11.3: Authentication Strategy** ‚úÖ
**Time**: 15 minutes  
**Status**: Complete

**Decision Made:** Cookie-Based Authentication

**Rationale:**
1. **Less Risk**: No automated login = lower chance of account suspension
2. **User Control**: User owns their account and cookies  
3. **Simpler**: No complex form automation or CAPTCHA handling
4. **Reliable**: Cookies are stable until expiration (30-60 days)

**Alternative Considered:**
- Automated login: Too risky, likely to trigger security measures
- API access: Not available for Marketplace
- Manual import: Fallback option if scraping becomes impossible

**Documentation Updated:**
- Added authentication strategy section to `FB_MARKETPLACE_RESEARCH.md`

---

### **Sub-Phase 11.4A: Cookie-Based Authentication Implementation** ‚úÖ
**Time**: 45 minutes  
**Status**: Complete

**Files Created/Modified:**
1. `backend/fb_cookies.json.template` - Template for user cookies
2. `backend/HOW_TO_GET_FB_COOKIES.md` - Comprehensive user guide (8 pages!)
3. `.gitignore` - Added fb_cookies.json to prevent accidental commits
4. `backend/scrapers/facebook_marketplace.py` - Complete rewrite with Playwright

**Implementation Details:**

**Cookie Loading:**
- `_load_cookies()` - Loads cookies from JSON file
- Validates JSON format
- Detects if template file is being used
- Returns None if cookies missing/invalid

**Cookie Conversion:**
- `_convert_cookies_to_playwright()` - Converts simple JSON to Playwright format
- Sets proper domain (.facebook.com), path (/), security flags
- Filters out non-cookie fields (like `_comment`, `_instructions`)

**Playwright Integration:**
- Launches Chromium browser in headless mode
- Creates browser context with realistic settings
- Injects cookies into browser context
- Navigates to Facebook Marketplace
- Detects authentication status (checks for login redirects)
- Handles timeouts and errors gracefully

**Code Structure:**
```python
def scrape_facebook_tijuana(max_results: int = 10, headless: bool = True):
    # Load cookies
    cookies = _load_cookies()
    
    # Launch Playwright
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=headless)
        context = browser.new_context(...)
        
        # Add cookies
        context.add_cookies(_convert_cookies_to_playwright(cookies))
        
        # Navigate and scrape
        page = context.new_page()
        page.goto("https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/...")
        
        # Check authentication
        # ... (extraction logic to be implemented)
```

**Testing:**
```bash
python backend/scrapers/facebook_marketplace.py
# Result: Correctly detects no cookies, shows helpful setup instructions
```

**User Experience:**
- Clear error messages if cookies missing
- Helpful setup instructions in output
- Links to documentation
- Template file with examples

### New Files:
1. `backend/scrapers/facebook_marketplace.py` (283 lines)
2. `backend/fb_cookies.json.template` (15 lines)
3. `backend/HOW_TO_GET_FB_COOKIES.md` (250+ lines)
4. `backend/FB_MARKETPLACE_RESEARCH.md` (179 lines)

### Modified Files:

### Total:
- **~730 lines** of new code/documentation
- **4 new files**
- **2 modified files**

---

## üöß Known Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **Requires User Cookies**: Can't scrape without user-provided authentication
2. **No Data Extraction Yet**: Framework complete, but extraction logic pending
3. **Untested with Real Data**: Can't fully test until user provides cookies
4. **FB Structure Unknown**: Facebook's HTML selectors need to be discovered

### By Design:
1. **No Automated Login**: Too risky, could trigger account locks
2. **Rate Limiting Not Implemented**: Will add after we can test
3. **No Proxy Support**: Not needed for personal use
4. **Single Region**: Focused on Tijuana only

---

### Phase 5: Integration (FINAL)
- ‚è≥ API endpoint
- ‚è≥ Database integration
- ‚è≥ UI display
- ‚è≥ End-to-end test

## üí° Lessons Learned

### Technical:
1. **Python 3.13 Compatibility**: Playwright 1.40.0 doesn't work, need 1.49.1+
2. **Cookie Format**: Playwright requires specific cookie structure with domain, path, flags
3. **Facebook Security**: Very aggressive blocking, requires full browser automation
4. **Error Messages Matter**: Clear, helpful messages significantly improve UX

### Process:
1. **Research First**: Spending time on research prevented false starts
2. **Small Increments Work**: Breaking into tiny phases kept progress steady
3. **Documentation is Key**: Comprehensive docs prevent user confusion
4. **Test Infrastructure Early**: Validating Playwright first saved debugging time

---

## üéì User Action Required

**To continue, the user must:**

1. **Open Facebook** in their browser
2. **Log in** to their account
3. **Install Cookie Editor extension** (Chrome/Firefox)
4. **Export cookies** from Facebook.com
5. **Create file**: `backend/fb_cookies.json`
6. **Paste cookies** into the file
7. **Run test**: `python backend/scrapers/facebook_marketplace.py`

**Full instructions in:** `backend/HOW_TO_GET_FB_COOKIES.md`

---

## üìà Completion Estimate

**Remaining Work:**
- Data extraction: 2-3 hours
- Testing with real data: 1-2 hours  
- API integration: 1 hour
- UI updates: 1 hour
- Final testing: 1 hour

**Total Remaining**: 6-8 hours  
**Blocker**: User must provide cookies first
