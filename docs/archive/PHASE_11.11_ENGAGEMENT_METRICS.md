# Phase 11.11: Facebook Engagement Metrics Extraction

**Parent Phase**: Phase 11 - Facebook Marketplace Scraper  
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress  
**Priority**: Medium (infrastructure exists, needs fine-tuning)

---

## Problem

The Facebook scraper is working and extracting listings, but engagement metrics (saves, views, messages) are returning `null`:

```json
{
  "title": "2010 Ford Fusion",
  "price": 40.0,
  "views": null,      // ‚ùå Not extracted
  "likes": null,      // ‚ùå Not extracted  
  "comments": null    // ‚ùå Not extracted
}
```

**Root Cause**: The regex patterns in `_extract_engagement_metrics()` don't match Facebook's actual HTML structure.

---

## Sub-Phase Breakdown

### **Sub-Phase 11.11.1: HTML Structure Analysis** (10 min)
**Goal**: Understand where engagement metrics appear in Facebook's HTML

**Tasks**:
1. Run scraper with `headless=False` to see the browser
2. Visit a listing page and inspect the HTML
3. Find where "X people saved", "X views", etc. appear
4. Document the actual HTML structure and class names
5. Take screenshots for reference

**Success Criteria**:
- Identify exact location of saves count
- Identify exact location of views (if shown)
- Identify exact location of messages/interested count
- Document selectors needed

---

### **Sub-Phase 11.11.2: Save HTML Snapshot** (5 min)
**Goal**: Capture raw HTML for offline analysis

**Tasks**:
1. Add code to save page HTML to file
2. Run scraper and save HTML of 1-2 listings
3. Search HTML file for engagement-related text
4. Identify patterns (class names, data attributes, etc.)

**Success Criteria**:
- HTML file saved to `fb_listing_sample.html`
- Can search for keywords like "saved", "views", "interested"
- Patterns identified

---

### **Sub-Phase 11.11.3: Update Extraction Logic** (15 min)
**Goal**: Implement correct selectors for engagement metrics

**Tasks**:
1. Update `_extract_engagement_metrics()` with real selectors
2. Try multiple selector strategies:
   - CSS selectors with Facebook's class names
   - Data attributes (data-testid, aria-label, etc.)
   - Text search with corrected patterns
3. Add fallback strategies
4. Add detailed debug logging

**Success Criteria**:
- At least one engagement metric extracted successfully
- Debug output shows what was found/not found
- Graceful handling if metrics unavailable

---

### **Sub-Phase 11.11.4: Test with Real Data** (10 min)
**Goal**: Verify extraction works on multiple listings

**Tasks**:
1. Run scraper on 5-10 different listings
2. Check which metrics are available
3. Verify data is correct (not extracting wrong numbers)
4. Test both old and new listings
5. Document which metrics are consistently available

**Success Criteria**:
- At least 50% of listings have some engagement data
- No false positives (wrong numbers extracted)
- Clear documentation of what's available

---

### **Sub-Phase 11.11.5: Update Tests** (10 min)
**Goal**: Add tests for engagement extraction

**Tasks**:
1. Update test HTML samples with real Facebook structure
2. Test extraction with known good HTML
3. Test edge cases (no metrics, very high numbers, etc.)
4. Update test expectations

**Success Criteria**:
- Tests pass with real Facebook HTML
- Edge cases covered
- No regressions in other tests

---

### **Sub-Phase 11.11.6: Documentation Update** (5 min)
**Goal**: Document findings and limitations

**Tasks**:
1. Update `FB_MARKETPLACE_RESEARCH.md` with actual findings
2. Note which metrics are available vs. not
3. Document any Facebook limitations
4. Update user guide if needed

**Success Criteria**:
- Documentation reflects reality
- Users know what to expect
- Troubleshooting info included

---

## Quick Start Option

If you want to **start immediately**, here's the fastest path:

### **Quick Sub-Phase: Debug & Extract** (20-30 min)

1. **Add HTML dump to scraper** (2 min)
2. **Run and capture HTML** (3 min)
3. **Analyze HTML manually** (10 min)
4. **Update selectors** (10 min)
5. **Test and verify** (5 min)

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case:
- All 3 metrics extractable (saves, views, messages)
- Works on 80%+ of listings
- Reliable selectors found

### Realistic Case:
- 1-2 metrics extractable (likely saves, maybe messages)
- Works on 50-70% of listings
- Views might not be publicly shown

### Worst Case:
- Metrics not publicly displayed by Facebook
- Only available when logged in to that specific account
- Fallback: Mark as "not available" and document

---

## Pivot Points

### If Metrics Not Found:
**Option A**: Accept limitation, document clearly
**Option B**: Try with different Facebook account
**Option C**: Use API if available (unlikely)

### If Selectors Keep Breaking:
**Option A**: Multiple fallback strategies
**Option B**: Machine learning approach (overkill)
**Option C**: Accept best-effort extraction

---

## Code Changes Needed

### 1. Add HTML Debugging (Quick)
```python
# In _fetch_listing_details()
with open(f'fb_debug_listing_{item_id}.html', 'w') as f:
    f.write(page.content())
```

### 2. Update Extraction (Main Work)
```python
def _extract_engagement_metrics(soup, listing):
    # Try multiple strategies
    
    # Strategy 1: CSS selectors
    saves = soup.select_one('[aria-label*="people saved"]')
    
    # Strategy 2: Data attributes  
    views = soup.find(attrs={'data-testid': 'listing-views'})
    
    # Strategy 3: Text search
    for text in soup.find_all(string=re.compile(r'\d+ saved')):
        # Extract number
        pass
```

### 3. Add Debug Output
```python
print(f"[DEBUG] Found saves element: {saves}")
print(f"[DEBUG] Extracted saves value: {saves_count}")
```

## Questions to Answer

Before we start:
1. **How important are engagement metrics** to you?
   - Critical ‚Üí Spend 1 hour on this
   - Nice to have ‚Üí Spend 30 min max
   - Optional ‚Üí Skip for now

2. **Which metrics matter most**?
   - Saves (most likely available)
   - Views (medium likelihood)
   - Messages/interested (least likely)

3. **Acceptable success rate**?
   - Must work on 80%+ listings

## ‚úÖ FINAL OUTCOME (2025-10-26)

### Investigation Completed

**User Decision**: Proceed with full investigation (Option 1: Accept Limitation after analysis)

**Investigation Results**:
1. ‚úÖ Captured HTML from authenticated listing pages (4.2MB each)
2. ‚úÖ Analyzed with multiple search strategies
3. ‚úÖ Tested patterns for saves, views, messages in Spanish and English
4. ‚ùå **Found NO engagement metrics in public HTML**

**Conclusion**:
**Facebook Marketplace does NOT publicly display engagement metrics** on listing pages. This is by design:
- Metrics only visible to sellers in their dashboard
- Intentional privacy/negotiation fairness decision
- Not available via scraping (even when authenticated)

**Actions Taken**:
1. ‚úÖ Updated `facebook_marketplace.py` with clear limitation documentation
2. ‚úÖ Updated `FB_MARKETPLACE_RESEARCH.md` with findings
3. ‚úÖ Created `PHASE_11.11_SUMMARY.md` with detailed analysis
4. ‚úÖ Database schema kept as-is (fields remain nullable for other platforms)

**Impact**:
- Facebook listings will have `views=NULL, likes=NULL, comments=NULL` (expected behavior)
- Tool still provides valuable data: price, mileage, location, vehicle specs
- Other platforms (Craigslist, Mercado Libre) may still support engagement metrics

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Limitation documented and accepted

**Time Spent**: 30 minutes (efficient investigation!)
